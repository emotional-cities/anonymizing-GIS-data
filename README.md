# GIS data anonymization workshop

In many contexts, geographic data can be considered as a directly identifying piece of information that needs to be anonymized. In this workshop, we will explore some techniques to anonymize spatial data using python and Postgis.

How can you use data in a way that protects individual privacy but still provides useful and meaningful analytics? Data anonymization is the process of removing personally identifiable information from data sets so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous. A proper anonymization process keeps the data functional for a given purpose.
In many scenarios, geographic data can be considered as a directly identifying piece of information that needs to be removed or anonymized. 
In this workshop, using some use cases from the eMOTIONAL Cities project, we will see how, applying techniques such as data obfuscation and data aggregation, using Postgis and python, it's still possible to distribute useful information and protect sensitive data.
